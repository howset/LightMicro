# Deconvolution

Here is the script for getting FWHM of deconvolution measurements of Tetraspeck bead samples.  

Notes:  

1. Only have 3 beads instead of the expected 5 or 6.
2. 4 channels: R, G, B, and IR.
3. 3 methods (iter,fast, and invfil) @ with theoretical PSF & measured PSF (dubbed here calc).

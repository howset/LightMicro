  abstract = {Abstract Total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy (TIRFM) is an elegant optical technique that provides for the excitation of fluorophores in an extremely thin axial region (“optical section”). The method is based on the principle that when excitation light is totally internally reflected in a transparent solid (e.g., coverglass) at its interface with liquid, an electromagnetic field, called the evanescent wave, is generated in the liquid at the solid-liquid interface and is the same frequency as the excitation light. Since the intensity of the evanescent wave exponentially decays with distance from the surface of the solid, only fluorescent molecules within a few hundred nanometers of the solid are efficiently excited. This unit will briefly review the history, optical theory, and different hardware configurations used in TIRFM. In addition, it will provide experimental details and methodological considerations for studying receptors at the plasma membrane in neurons. Curr. Protoc.

  abstract     = {Various mechanisms are often employed in fluorescence microscopy applications to restrict the excitation and detection of fluorophores to a thin region of the specimen. Elimination of background fluorescence from outside the focal plane can dramatically improve the signal-to-noise ratio, and consequently, the spatial resolution of the features or events of interest. Total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) exploits the unique properties of an induced evanescent wave or field in a limited specimen region immediately adjacent to the interface between two media having different refractive indices. In practice, the most commonly utilized interface in the application of TIRFM is the contact area between a specimen and a glass coverslip or tissue culture container.

The concepts underlying TIRFM are not new, and much of the recent interest in, and enthusiasm for, the technique have come about due to technological advances that facilitate its use. The availability of complete ready-to-use instrumentation systems for employment of the method, as well as developments in fluorophore technology, such as genetically encoded fluorescent species, have made it possible to investigate a number of cell membrane and other surface processes in a direct manner that was not previously possible.},

  abstract = {Background: In the cortical region of motile cells, the actin network rapidly reorganizes as required for movement in various directions and for cell-to-substrate adhesion. The analysis of actin network dynamics requires the combination of high-resolution imaging with a specific fluorescent probe that highlights the filamentous actin structures in live cells. Results: Combining total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy with a method for labeling actin filaments, we analyze the dynamics of actin patterns in the highly motile cells of Dictyostelium. A rapidly restructured network of single or bundled actin filaments provides a scaffold for the assembly of differentiated actin complexes. Recruitment of the Arp2/3 complex characterizes stationary foci with a lifetime of 7–10 s and traveling waves. These structures are also formed in the absence of myosin-II. Arp2/3-actin assemblies similar to those driving the protrusion of a leading edge form freely at the inner face of the plasma membrane. Conclusions: The actin system of highly motile cells runs far from equilibrium and generates a multitude of patterns within a dynamic filamentous network. Traveling waves are the most complicated patterns based on recruitment of the Arp2/3 complex. They are governed by the propagated induction of actin polymerization. We hypothesize that the actin system autonomously generates primordia of specialized structures such as phagocytic cups or lamellipodia. These primordia would represent an activated state of the actin system and enable cells to respond within seconds to local stimuli by chemotaxis or phagocytic-cup formation.},

  abstract = {1. Blowfly salivary glands have been used extensively as a model system for the analysis of inositol phosphate-dependent signal transduction. To detect and characterize changes in intracellular free calcium ([Ca2+]i) that might be expected to be triggered by stimulation with serotonin (5-HT), we have carried out digital calcium-imaging experiments on intact glands using the Ca2+-sensitive dye fura-2. 2. 5-HT (1-10 nM) induced repetitive transient increases in [Ca2+]i, i.e. Ca2+ spikes whose frequency was a function of agonist concentration (EC50 = 2.8 nM). 3. Pre-incubation in EGTA decreased the frequency but did not inhibit spiking. Thapsigargin abolished periodic spike activity indicating that the [Ca2+]i rise results from Ca2+ release. Neither caffeine (10 mM) nor ryanodine (10 and 50 microM) induced increases in [Ca2+]i. 4. Oscillatory activity in individual cells was synchronized by regenerative intercellular Ca2+ waves that propagated over distances greater than 400 microm. Colliding waves annihilated each other. 5. Desynchronization of the oscillation pattern by 100 microM 1-octanol suggests the involvement of gap junctions and an intracellular messenger in wave propagation. 6. Local stimulation of glands elicited [Ca2+]i elevations in the stimulated area, but not in adjacent cells, indicating that local increases in [Ca2+]i are not sufficient to trigger Ca2+ waves. However, local stimulation was capable of evoking propagating Ca2+ waves when combined with low-dose 5-HT stimulation of the whole gland. 7. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that: (1) Ca2+ acts as the intercellular messenger and modulates its own release via positive and negative feedback on the inosital 1,4,5-trisphosphate (InsP3) receptor, and (2) sensitization of the InsP3 receptor to Ca2+ by InsP3 is required for the propagation of intercellular Ca2+ waves, as proposed for intracellular Ca2+ waves in Xenopus oocytes.},

Over the past decade, many new technologies and techniques have been developed that allow for combinations of deeper, faster, and higher resolution imaging. These have included the commercialization of many super-resolution and light sheet fluorescence microscopy techniques. For the non-expert, it can be difficult to match the best imaging techniques to biological questions. Picking the most appropriate imaging modality requires a basic understanding of the underlying physics governing each of them, as well as information comparing potentially competing imaging properties in the context of the sample to be imaged. To address these issues, we provide here concise descriptions of a wide range of commercially available imaging techniques from wide-field to super-resolution microscopy, and provide a tabular guide to aid in comparisons among them. In this manner we provide a concise guide to understanding and matching the correct imaging modality to meet research needs. © 2017 by John Wiley \& Sons, Inc.},

With the most powerful implementations of LSFM available to only a few groups worldwide, the scope of this technique is unnecessarily limited. Here we elucidate the key developments and define a simple set of underlying principles governing LSFM.

The quantification of protein oligomerization in the native cellular environment is highly relevant for a detailed understanding of complex biological processes. An important parameter in this context is the molecular brightness, which serves as a direct measure of oligomerization and can be easily extracted from temporal or spatial fluorescence fluctuations. However, fluorescent proteins (FPs) typically used in such studies suffer from complex photophysical transitions and limited maturation, inducing non-fluorescent states. Here, we show how these processes strongly affect molecular brightness measurements. We perform a systematic characterization of non-fluorescent states for commonly used FPs and provide a simple guideline for accurate, unbiased oligomerization measurements in living cells. Further, we focus on novel red FPs and demonstrate that mCherry2, an mCherry variant, possesses superior properties with regards to precise quantification of oligomerization.},

Genome-editing technology has now made this powerful approach routinely applicable to mammalian cells and many other model systems, thereby opening up the possibility to systematically and quantitatively map the cellular proteome in four dimensions. 3D time-lapse confocal microscopy (4D imaging) is an essential tool for investigating spatial and temporal protein dynamics; however, it lacks the required quantitative power to make the kind of absolute and comparable measurements required for systems analysis. In contrast, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) provides quantitative proteomic and biophysical parameters such as protein concentration, hydrodynamic radius, and oligomerization but lacks the capability for high-throughput application in 4D spatial and temporal imaging. Here we present an automated experimental and computational workflow that integrates both methods and delivers quantitative 4D imaging data in high throughput. These data are processed to yield a calibration curve relating the fluorescence intensities (FIs) of image voxels to the absolute protein abundance. The calibration curve allows the conversion of the arbitrary FIs to protein amounts for all voxels of 4D imaging stacks. Using our workflow, users can acquire and analyze hundreds of FCS-calibrated image series to map their proteins of interest in four dimensions. Compared with other protocols, the current protocol does not require additional calibration standards and provides an automated acquisition pipeline for FCS and imaging data. The protocol can be completed in 1 d.},

Modern imaging technology has brought about a revolution in the kinds of questions we can approach, but this comes at the price of increasingly complex equipment. Moreover, in an attempt to market competing systems, the microscopes have often been inappropriately described as easy to use and suitable for near-beginners. Insufficient understanding of the experimental manipulations and equipment set-up leads to the introduction of errors during image acquisition. In this feature, I review some of the most common practical pitfalls faced by researchers during image acquisition, and how they can affect the interpretation of the experimental data. This article is targeted neither to the microscopy gurus who push forward the frontiers of imaging technology nor to my imaging specialist colleagues who may wince at the overly simplistic comments and lack of detail. Instead, this is for beginners who gulp with alarm when they hear the word “confocal pinhole” or sigh as they watch their cells fade and die in front of their very eyes time and time again at the microscope.

This is based on its primary structure, subcellular localization, and regulation during mitosis, and its requirement of the C-terminal CaaX box as a posttranslational processing signal for proper localization. Our knockout and overexpression mutants revealed an important role for NE81 in nuclear integrity, chromatin organization, and mechanical stability of cells. All our results are in agreement with a role for NE81 in formation of a nuclear lamina. This function is corroborated by localization of Dictyostelium NE81 at the nuclear envelope in human cells. The discovery of a lamin-like protein in a unicellular organism is not only intriguing in light of evolution, it may also provide a simple experimental platform for studies of the molecular basis of laminopathies.},

  abstract = {The nuclear envelope consists of the outer and the inner nuclear membrane, the nuclear lamina and the nuclear pore complexes, which regulate nuclear import and export. The major con-stituent of the nuclear lamina of Dictyostelium is the lamin NE81. It can form filaments like B-type lamins and it interacts with Sun1, as well as with the LEM/HeH-family protein Src1. Sun1 and Src1 are nuclear envelope transmembrane proteins involved in the centrosome-nucleus connection and nuclear envelope stability at the nucleolar regions, respectively. In conjunction with a KASH-domain protein, Sun1 usually forms a so-called LINC complex. Two proteins with functions reminiscent of KASH-domain proteins at the outer nuclear membrane of Dictyostelium are known; interaptin which serves as an actin connector and the kinesin Kif9 which plays a role in the microtubule-centrosome connector. However, both of these lack the conserved KASH-domain. The link of the centrosome to the nuclear envelope is essential for the insertion of the centrosome into the nuclear envelope and the appropriate spindle formation. Moreover, centrosome insertion is involved in permeabiliza-tion of the mitotic nucleus, which ensures access of tubulin dimers and spindle assembly factors. Our recent progress in identifying key molecular players at the nuclear envelope of Dictyosteliumpromises further insights into the mechanisms of nuclear envelope dynamics.},

  abstract = {With Airyscan, ZEISS introduced a new detector concept for confocal laser-scanning microscopy (LSM). Whereas traditional LSM designs use a combination of pinhole and single-point detectors, Airyscan is a 32-channel gallium arsenide phosphide photomultiplier tube (GaAsP-PMT) area detector that collects a pinhole-plane image at every scan position. Each detector element functions as a single, very small pinhole. Knowledge about the beam path and the spatial distribution of each detector channel enables very light-efficient imaging with improved resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.},

  abstract               = {In recent years fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) has become a routine method for determining diffusion coefficients, chemical rate constants, molecular concentrations, fluorescence brightness, triplet state lifetimes, and other molecular parameters. FCS measures the spatial and temporal correlation of individual molecules with themselves and so provides a bridge between classical ensemble and contemporary single-molecule measurements. It also provides information on concentration and molecular number fluctuations for nonlinear reaction systems that complement single-molecule measurements. Typically implemented on a fluorescence microscope, FCS samples femtoliter volumes and so is especially useful for characterizing small dynamic systems such as biological cells. In addition to its practical utility, however, FCS provides a window on mesoscopic systems in which fluctuations from steady states not only provide the basis for the measurement but also can have important consequences for the behavior and evolution of the system. For example, a new and potentially interesting field for FCS studies could be the study of nonequilibrium steady states, especially in living cells.},

These devices provide a powerful means to eliminate from images the background caused by out-of-focus light and scatter. Confocal techniques can also improve the resolution of a light microscope image beyond what is achievable with widefield fluorescence microscopy. The quality of the images obtained, however, depends on the user's familiarity with the optical and fluorescence concepts that underlie this approach. We describe the core concepts of confocal microscopes and important variables that adversely affect confocal images. We also discuss data-processing methods for confocal microscopy and computational optical sectioning techniques that can perform optical sectioning without a confocal microscope.},

Advanced fluorescence techniques such as lifetime imaging and correlation spectroscopy are also available. Newly developed target-specific probes allow investigation of new aspects of microbial communities. Several new laser-based techniques are available including nanoscopy and mesoscale techniques. Nanoscopy techniques offer access to unprecedented resolution of hydrated microbiological samples at the scale of fluorescent gene products and macromolecules. Mesoscale approaches are important to address larger features and statistical issues of microbiological samples.

We discovered that by synthesizing a swellable polymer network within a specimen, it can be physically expanded, resulting in physical magnification. By covalently anchoring specific labels located within the specimen directly to the polymer network, labels spaced closer than the optical diffraction limit can be isotropically separated and optically resolved, a process we call expansion microscopy (ExM). Thus, this process can be used to perform scalable superresolution microscopy with diffraction-limited microscopes. We demonstrate ExM with apparent ~70-nanometer lateral resolution in both cultured cells and brain tissue, performing three-color superresolution imaging of ~10(7) cubic micrometers of the mouse hippocampus with a conventional confocal microscope.},

A computer-based image processing algorithm is designed to automatically classify microscopic images of yeast cells in a microfluidic channel environment. The images were enhanced to reduce background noise, and a robust segmentation algorithm is developed to extract geometrical features including compactness, axis ratio, and bud size. The features are then used for classification, and the accuracy of various machine-learning classifiers is compared. The linear support vector machine, distance-based classification, and k-nearest-neighbor algorithm were the classifiers used in this experiment. The performance of the system under various illumination and focusing conditions were also tested. The results suggest it is possible to automatically classify yeast cells based on their morphological characteristics with noisy and low-contrast images.},

\section{Introduction}

\paragraph{Aim} To obtain/restore high resolution images using deconvolution methods. 
\\

High resolution microscopy is often plagued by blurriness due diffractions (convolution). 
Inverse convolution (deconvolution) methods can be performed to obtain convolution-free images by describing a mathematical function called the Point Spread Function (PSF) to recalculate diffracted light, stray light, and out-of-focus light back to its origin~\cite{Lect10}.

\section{Methods}

Two samples, 200 nm Tetraspeck beads and \textit{Dictyostelium discoideum} cells (AX2 line) were used in this experiment. 
Deconvolution was performed using three methods; (constrained) iterative, fast iterative, and (regularized) inverse filter, each obtained by calculation of PSF from direct measurement in the experiment (measured/M) and through calculation from the parameters of the device (theoretical/T). 
To obtain the FWHM, a line profile measurement was done for each beads, for each channels. 
Afterwards procedures for gaussian fit and averaging were done in \faPython Python (script available publicly on \href{https://gitup.uni-potsdam.de/showard/lightmicroscopy}{\faGitlab~gitUP}, or by request).

\label{fig:beads}
\end{figure}


The 200 nm Tetraspeck beads emit at 4 different wavelengths: 430 nm (blue), 515 nm (green), 580 nm (orange) and 680 nm (dark red)~\cite{Tetra}, these correspond to Ch3, Ch2, Ch1, and Ch4 in the case of this experiment. 
The beads were imaged as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:beads}. During the experiment, only three good beads that could be found. 
From the raw (input) image, a PSF was calculated (measured PSF). 
The PSF obtained in this way was then used for deconvolution purposes. Another PSF was calculated (theoretically) from various imaging parameters/device parameters and also used for deconvolution procedures (theoretical PSF) as a comparison. 

At first glance, it can be observed the various deconvolution methods (iterative, fast iterative, and inverse filter) performed differently, especially in the z-dimension. 
It can also be noticed that there is a different focus of the different channels, most prominently seen, again, in the z-dimension. 
This could be caused by chromatic abberations. 
This shift in focus that can be seen on all images could also be caused by movement of the filter carousel when changing measurement channel during imaging that does not retain the same original focus. 
Another immediate observation shows that the green channel exhibit a relatively rough background noise which is typical (not shown).

Comparing the measured deconvolutions and the theoretical ones, it is immediately obvious that the resolution in the z-dimension of the measured is better than the theoretical. 
Calculating the FWHM of each deconvolution methods would give a better overview of the performance of the deconvolution methods in the xy-dimension. 
This is done by taking a line profile (intensity profile) of all acquired beads on all channels, then make a gaussian fit of the intensity profile and calculate the FWHM of each bead on each channel. 
Lastly, average the obtained FWHM (of the three beads) for each channel. 
In principal, the resolution in z-dimension can also be obtained in a similar way, however the difference would seem that in this dimension, the object would be in a different shape (more elongated), and also consequently the intensity profile should be taken along the z-axis.

The gaussian fits were first performed using an offset parameter due to the presence of measurements that seems to be off the baseline (channel 2 of the input image). 
However this seems to set the gaussian fit to fail on some other measurements. 
Adjusting the initial guess of this parameter (and also the others: A, $\mu$, and $\sigma$) seem to remedy the failure on these measurements, however it would then arbitrarily cause failure on completely different measurements. 
Since no pattern or explanation could be obtained, it was then decided to make a baseline correction to the initially problematic measurements, namely channel 2 of the input image by substracting the intensity values with the minimum value which provides the baseline of around 0, putting them on the same baseline level as the other measurements. 
This allows for the removal of the offset term of the fit and resulted in the successful application of the whole fitting procedure. 
It is probably also worth mentioning that no intensity normalization was conducted due to the fact that the fit at this point seems fine already.

The result of this is given in Tab.~\ref{tab:avfwhm} and visualized in a barplot in Fig.~\ref{fig:avfwhmbar}. 
It can be seen here, that the FWHM of the input image is naturally the largest, due to the fact that no deconvolution procedures was performed. 
The FWHM of the input image is around 30\% larger than the actual size of the beads (200 nm), and all attempts of the deconvolution procedures managed to bring the FWHM lower. 
It can be concluded that all methods using measured PSF consistently performs better on all channels than methods using theoretical PSF except in the case of measurement of fast iterative method on channel 4 where the values are really close. 
And among the three deconvolution methods, fast iterative constantly yields the smallest FWHM on all channels.

The optical resolution following the Rayleigh criterion, given by $d=0.61\times(\lambda/NA)$, where $d$ is minimum distance where two points are resolved, $\lambda$ is the wavelength of illumination, and $NA$ is the numerical aperture of the lense, yield for each channel 1-4 (i.e. red/orange, green, blue, and dark red/infrared): 252.71 nm, 224.39 nm, 187.35 nm, and 296.28 nm respectively. 
Given that the minimum distance for two points to be considered resolved is where the maximum of one point is directly on the first minimum of the other peak ($\approx$ FWHM), it seems that at least in the xy-dimension, the calculated FWHM of all deconvolution methods at all considered channels does not correspond all that well with the Rayleigh criterion.
 
Although in principal, it is known that the iterative method should give the best resulting image quality because of its ability to calculate light from various focal planes back to its place of origin, with the disadvantage being that it may take a long time for this deconvolution method to be performed due to the number of iterations in performing deconvolution algorithm (40 in this case). 
The fast iterative method is basically the same with the limitation on the number of iterations. 
The inverse filter is a method that involves a Fourier transformation and is the fastest method among these three.

%The discrepancies observed here could probably be contributed to the inoptimally acquired PSF

\subsection{AX2 cells}

The PSF obtained from previous experiment on tetraspeck beads was then used for the deconvolution of AX2 cells images (Fig.~\ref{fig:ax2mon}~(Left), the composite and channel breakdown of raw/input image). 
The following organelles are labelled: nucleus by DAPI, CP91 (core of centrosome) by anti-rabbit-AlexaFluor568, and CP224 (corona of centrosome) by anti-mouse-AlexaFluor488.
%Fluorescence label: anti-rabbit-AlexaFluor568 (red color, CP91 core of the centrosome), anti-mouse-AlexaFluor488 (green color, CP224 corona of the centrosome) and DAPI (blue, nucleus) (from expansion protocol).

A montage image of each organelle according to the deconvolution methods is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ax2mon}~(Right). 
Here it can be seen that most deconvolution methods bring better image results in comparison to the raw/input image where contrasts are improved and structures are more readily recognizable. 
The size of CP91 is shown to be the smallest for the fast iterative method in comparison to other methods. 
This is consistent with the result from the discussion above where this deconvolution method yields the smallest FWHM. 

The iterative method with measured PSF produces a good CP224 images along with the vague fluorescence signals of AlexaFluor-488 bound to the $+$ ends of the microtubules. 
This feature can also be observed with the fast iterative method using measured PSF, though very vague, and seems absent in the method using theoretical PSF for both iterative and fast iterative. 
The inverse filter method seem to produce a mottling artifact in this channel. 
A mottling artifact is a phenomenon where signals, particularly noise in the background gets amplified by deconvolution algorithms. 
This phenomenon occurs usually with inversion algorithms, but iterative algorithms are also not free from this~\cite{DecArtif}. 
%Hence it is a possibility that the feature shown with both the iterative methods are also actually a mottling artifact, just to a lesser degree. This feature in the fast iterative method is not as prominent, speculatively due to the fact that the iteration in this method is limited so as the noise amplification is not as much as with the iterative method.

Inspecting the DAPI channel, it can be easily seen that the fast iterative method produces a much grainier image in comparison to the iterative method, both for the theoretical and measured PSF. 
This occurs on both previous channels of this method as well, just more prominently displayed here. 
This can be attributed to the limited number of iterations used in this method in comparison to the iterative method. 
The resulting images from the inverse filter method show, again, an artifact, which is arguably a ringing artifact. This artifact has an appearance of dark ripples around bright features of an image~\cite{DecArtif}.  

As a comparison, another set of images were also acquired for the iterative method using measured PSF, however this time using background correction. 
This acquisition shows a better form of the nucleus in the DAPI channel but does not seem to inroduce major improvements for the other two channels in this observation. 
Another voluntary acquisition was also conducted for the inverse filter method using measured PSF. 
This time the artifacts appear less prominent and the images look more appropriate.

For the most part, the ability of the methods employed to restore images has a lot to do with the PSF itself and the raw image being restored, in terms that the PSF that is used should match the corresponding image. 
If there are aberrations in the image, then the PSF should also contain a corresponding aberrations as well. 
Otherwise, the deconvolved image may contain errors or be poorly restored~\cite{DecArtif}. 
Managing appropriate settings during image acquisitions also plays a major role.

%Notes:\\
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Beads are bad so only 3 bead samples instead of the usual 5. Cy5 is excluded because there is no signal of Cy5 (can only get from the theo --> not measured) channel 4 is IR
%\item To avoid beam shift --> get full z stack per channel --> not changing filter cube carousel during measurement in different channel. --> If there is shift in x-y, then maybe due to changing in the filter carousel (?)
%\item Use tetraspeck 200nm. Smaller beads may be better, but fluorescence may be weak. Can also be bigger, but not necessarily better. Can be seen from Z stack there is different focus on different channel --> due to chromatic abberration
%\item Deconv is worse with thicker tissue (if there are lots of out of focus information), more spherical abberration the deeper it gets into the specimen.
%\item theo is worse than measured in z dimension --> lect optical sectioning 01
%\item Shift on channels, how to align? --> not necessary, because shift is due to filter carousel
%\item Task 1: Make pic like Fig.~\ref{fig:beads}
%\item Task 2: How to get FWHM here? \textcolor{red}{Calculate mean values and standard deviation and finally give an estimation of the achievable resolution according to the Rayleigh criterion.} --> open real file in fiji, make line, get profile, save, then do fwhm by python(?)
%\item \textcolor{red}{Clear up with Julius: Image just composite only?}
%\item \textcolor{red}{Clear up with Julius: FWHM Avoid airydiscs, but several z stacks while beads in focus, right?}
%\item nearest neighbour simple and very fast. reg inv fil is fast and better. fast iterative is good with medium speed. constrained iterative is excellent but slow.
%\item constrained iterative: The best image quality is achieved using the iterative maximum likelihood algorithm (see Schaefer et al.: "Generalized approach for accelerated maximum likelihood based image restoration applied to three-dimensional fluorescence microscopy", J. of Microscopy, Vol. 204, Pt 2, November 2001, pp. 99ff.). This algorithm is able to calculate light from various focal planes back to its place of origin. Consequently, with this method it is possible to derive the 3D structure from fluorescence images with the correct brightness distribution and to visualize optical sections. It is also possible for missing information to be partially restored from neighboring voxels.
%The spatial resolution can be increased without artifacts up to a theoretical limit (one voxel). It is essential for Z-stacks to have been acquired in accordance with Nyquist. Acquiring sufficient planes above and below the structure of interest is also imperative for achieving good results. As this is a complex mathematical method, the calculation can take longer, depending on the image size and the PC being used.
%\item The "Fast Iterative" method is an iterative restoration method that uses only one iteration per convolution step (see Meinel, E. S.: Origins of linear and nonlinear recursive restoration algorithms. J.Opt.Soc.Am, 3 (6), 1986, 787-799). No
%regularization is used in this case. Due to the fast processing and convergence after just a few iterations, this method is suitable in particular for the processing of larger time lapse images. The results of the method can quickly lead to good results and remove most of the out-of-focus light. They do not, however, create quantitative brightness conditions in the image. If undersampled images are present, artifact formation may also result. Zenblue software guide
%\item The inverse filter is a genuine 3D method and generally achieves better results than the Nearest Neighbor algorithm. It essentially involves dividing the Fourier transformation ("FT") of the volume by the FT of the PSF, which can be performed very quickly. In the real space this corresponds to deconvolution. In addition, a statistical method ("General Cross Validation – GCV") is applied, which determines the noise component of the image and automatically sets the restoration strength to the optimum level in line with this. This process is also known as regularization.
%The method is very well suited to the processing of several image stacks in order to preselect images for the application of the iterative "high-end" method. Z-stacks must, however, have been acquired at the correct (Nyquist) distance. The additional acquisition of Z-planes above and below the structure of interest is recommended. idem
